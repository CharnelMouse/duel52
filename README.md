A program for playing Duel 52, to practise domain modelling for card games.

Work in progress: UI in place, implementing the game rules.

- Basic actions: play card, activate, attack, make pair. Cards ready at the end of the turn.
- Players only see known information (except who's peeked at face-down cards).
- Bases become activatable when the draw pile empties.
- Lanes can be won, the game currently cannot.
  - Lanes can also be tied if there are no troops at any point after the bases flip, I'm not sure whether this is correct.
- No card abilities yet.
