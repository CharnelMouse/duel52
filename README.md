A program for playing Duel 52, to practise domain modelling for card games.

Work in progress: UI in place, basic play rules implemented. Need to implement card abilities.

- Basic actions: play card, activate, attack, make pair. Cards ready at the end of the turn.
- Players only see known information (except who's peeked at face-down cards).
- Bases become activatable when the draw pile empties.
- Lanes and lanes can be won, or tied.
  - Lanes can currently be tied if there are no troops at any point after the bases flip, preventing anyone playing there. I'm not sure whether this is correct.
- No card abilities yet.

Future extensions:

- Variants with 1, 3, or 4 players
- Expansion: Heroes, Bannermen, Forts
