A program for playing Duel 52, to practise domain modelling for card games.

Work in progress: UI in place, implementing the game rules.

- Basic actions: play card, activate, attack, make pair.
- Players only see known information (except who's peeked at face-down cards).
- Bases become activatable when the draw pile empties
  - Currently also become known by controller, this is a bug.
- Lanes / the game currently cannot be won.
- No card abilities yet.
